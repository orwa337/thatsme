        <p>Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; it may have been inhabited since the 6th millennium BC.[9] Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari, just south of the old city of Aleppo, show that the area was occupied by Amorites since at least the latter part of the 3rd millennium BC.[10] This is also when Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and Mesopotamia, in which it is a part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, and is noted for its commercial and military proficiency.[11] Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center midway between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia</p>

    <!-- TASK:

        Write a page about yourself.

        - Does not need to be responsive
        - When the document is loaded, all your content is slowly faded in
        - Include a header, a content and a footer
        - The navigation is located in the header and consists of three links
          "About me", "My favourite city", "My favourite songs"
          whereas the default behaviour is prevented and replaced by your own click events instead
        - All click events for the links change your main content accordingly
            - how you implement it, is up to you
        - When clicking a navigation link, your content changes with a JQuery animation of your choice

        "About me" -> 1 or 2 paragraphs about yourself
        "My favourite city" -> 1 paragraph about your city, including a nice picture
        "My favourite songs" -> Embed 2 or 3 Songs from Youtube in your page
                                (Google how to do that)

        - when the user presses the left arrow key, he will go back in navigation. i.e. if he is at "My favourite city", he will navigate to "About me"
        - when the user presses the right arrow key, he will go further in navigation, i.e. if he is at "My favourite city", he will navigate to "My favourite songs"
